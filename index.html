    <p>A <a href="https://g.co/kgs/nhiW8JL"> "Hello, World"</a> program is generally a simple computer program which outputs (or displays) to the screen (often the console) a message similar to <a href="https://g.co/kgs/nhiW8JL"> "Hello, World!"</a> while ignoring any user input. A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. A "Hello, World!" program is often the first written by a student of a new programming language,[1] but such a program can also be used as a sanity check to ensure that the computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it.</p>
